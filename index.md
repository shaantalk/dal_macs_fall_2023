We are students of MACS at Dalhousie University for the Fall 2023 intake.

These are a few notes and links that helped us during the selection, interview, visa, course selection, etc.

## Here are a few general topics


### Steps from application to admit for Dalhousie's MACS program
1. Apply
2. After 2-5 days you will get a mail for GradApp. Upload your docs and add your referee details for LORs
3. After 2-3 days you will get a mail for setting up the interview. Choose a date in the link provided in the mail.
4. Take the interview
5. Within 2-3 days you will be recommended and you will get a mail from the CS Faculty
6. After 2-3 days to a week of recommendation you will get the offer letter. They send out offer letters only on Tuesdays and Thrusdays ( AST Timezone )

### Got recommended ? But don't know you will get admit or not ?

This is all we know about who is 100% getting offer letter

Only if all three of the below conditions r satisfied

1. Got recommendation letter via mail
2. GradApp portal open with "recommendation" tab selected
3. DalOnline portal says "Deposit Requested"

### For rejection cases this is what I have observed for MACS program.

Scene 1:
GradApp portal status goes from under review to direct recommendation without interview.

Scene 2:
GradApp portal goes from under review to recommendation status but haven't got any email with recommendation letter pdf.


### Mail after payment of deposit

Send this mail to CS Faculty and CC to Graduate Studies

```
Hello,

I have attached the payment confirmation slip of $ 200.00 CAD deposit for the reservation and the offer letter provided by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.

My Banner ID / Dal ID: B00****

Thanks & Regards,

### Got offer letter, but can I pay the fees now?

Dal will mail us the fee structure of Fall 2023 intake soon but we can start paying from now. On mailing about this to the accounts department, they have send us the previous Fall intake's fee structure. If you need this, we can send in the admit only group.
