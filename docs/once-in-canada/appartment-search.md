# Apartment Search

Most of the new students try to share the apartment with existing students if it is so then they can find the accommodation by joining the group and posting for availability. 

If someone wants to sign-up for a new lease then they have to be in Canada and do the following steps:

- Reach out to the reception/office of the apartment you want to live in /reach out to the house owner if you want an individual apartment and schedule an appointment.
- Have a look at apartments and check whether it satisfies your needs or not.
- Provide required documents 
  - Passport
  - Study permit
  - Proof of funds (Mostly GIC / if you already have a job then you can provide them payslip)
  - Wait for the documents verification which can take one or two days, then you will get approval and move-in date.
