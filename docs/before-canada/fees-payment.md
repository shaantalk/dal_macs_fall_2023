# Fees Payment

You have to pay one year's fees to the university before applying visa under Student Direct Stream (SDS) category.

There are many websites that allows us to pay the money like Convera, Cohortgo etc. During my fee payment I found [Cohortgo](https://my.cohortgo.com/) to be best at conversion rate, service charge and smoothness of service.

## TCS Tax

TCS meaning tax collected at source is a tax levied by government on specified transactions.

In case you are sending money abroad to cover educational expenses, there is an exemption from TCS up to a maximum of Rs.7 lakh.

For transactions above this threshold, TCS charges of 0.5% will be applicable if the funds are being provided via a loan.

If these expenses are being met via any other income source, 5% TCS is applicable for transactions exceeding the maximum threshold. Furthermore, if the person remitting the amount cannot prove that the money is being sent for educational purposes, the TCS rate will be 20%.

In other websites, we have to go to a bank to submit the **education loan sanction letter** but in Cohortgo this was done via email.

## Amount

I have send 33000 CAD. Others have send in the range of 30k to 35k CAD.

## Documents needed

1: Education Loan Sanction Letter
2: A2 form (Downloadable from cohortgo's portal)
